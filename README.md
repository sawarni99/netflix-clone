# Netflix Landing Page

I have create the responsive landing page UI of netflix with React.JS and vanilla CSS. I have tried to clone all the effects from netflix page which includes

* Zooming out the title and description from the preview video after 5 seconds of autoplay.
* Auto play video and pausing it when More Info is cicked from the preview video.
* Video will be resuming from the extact time when it was paused when Info tab is closed.
* Netflix Carousel with sliding Effect and zoom when hovered for 500ms.
* Making Navigation Bar color as solid if scrolled down and transparent when scrolled all the way up.
* Search Bar open/close effect.
* Showing profile Menu when hovered effect.
